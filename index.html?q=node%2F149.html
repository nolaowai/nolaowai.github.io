a) Summary of problems.  Having finished the previous (long!) section, let us review the problems facing the English language graduate.  First, there is no “foreign friend” to communicate with.  Second, a foreign friend is seen as an essential catalyst for further language development.  Third, “American English” and “American accent” are viewed as essential parts of the language acquisition process by many students.  In summary, many believe as follows: no foreign friend, no way forward.  These beliefs form a very powerful barrier of inertia.  The root of the inertia is dependence, and the solution lies in independence. <br />
b) Dependence in you.  Perhaps you will hate me for saying this, but the beginnings of linguistic dependence are in many of you.  First is what I call the tyranny of “so-so”.  When asked for their feelings on an issue, many students will reply “so-so” (not hot and not cold, not big and not small).  This attitude permeates much of many students’ thinking.  Second, this way of thinking translates into action—or rather, lack of it.  The major sign or symptom is an unwillingness to “vote”, to take sides, to stand out, to speak up.  (Remember, we are talking about taking sides in an oral English discussion class, not a national election.)  It is impossible to run if you do not first stand up. <br />
c) Dependence on foreign speakers among college students.  Consider the relationships between college students and foreign teachers… in “English corners”, “free talks”, and at English language “events”:<br />
i )  In many “English corners”, you will know where the foreigners are, because there are many students around them.  This “clustering” is really proof of the “survival of the fittest” among the students, the vanity of some foreigners, and the helpless frustration of the shy or meek students.  For some foreigners, the “celebrity status” is stressful.  The purpose (as you know) of an “English corner” is for people to meet others and talk English with them.  Whether or not a foreigner attends makes no difference! <br />
ii)  In many “free talks”, many students remain silent.  They surrender their right to be heard to the “dominant” students in the group, or they come with no topic or agenda (“Failing to plan….”).  In addition, they are silenced by their over-speaking teacher, such that “free talk” becomes “free listen”.  (I do admit that this is my problem.) <br />
iii)  Foreign teachers are often used as publicity banners, hosts, or judges at large student gatherings (such as speech or debate competitions). Here, however, they have less of a leadership role, which is the way it should be.<br />
d )  Dependence on “American English” and “American accent” as a necessary precondition for and authentic language experience.<br />
i )  Let’s face it.  To speak English with an American accent is a goal avidly pursued by many students today.  They buy the books, listen to the tapes, and practice—and they try very hard, too.  VCD’s of contemporary sitcoms from America are more and more popular.  The days of Humphrey Bogart saying, “Here’s looking at you, kid!” in “Casablanca” are now out of fashion (unfortunately). <br />
ii )  Accent/pronunciation is favored over conversation or grammar by many students.  You think not?  Some people labor to “sound American” (they don’t; it is horrible), and their speech is full of grammar mistakes.  The “middle part” (i.e., conversation; the ability to synthesize yourself in English—into clear, logical speech) is partly or largely missing.  It is this middle part of language that is the heart of communicative language—and it has been neglected, and accent/pronunciation has been “chased” instead.  From a linguistic point of view, substance has been subverted by style. <br />
iii)  The job market favors “American accent” speakers over others.  This too places a burden on language learners, as they seek to conform to outside expectations. <br />
iv)  At present, America is perceived as a major world power, providing influence, jobs, opportunities, wealth, mobility, and power.  Therefore, “accent” follows the power.  Before, it was British English; before that, it was French; and before that, it was Latin.  In time, this linguistic state of affairs will be changed as another international/world language takes over—Chinese?  Hey, with no verb or noun changes, why not?!<br />
v )  North America is still a major immigration destination.  This affects the great importance given accent/pronunciation. <br />
vi ) Some of my students have criticized me for saying these things—that’s O.K.!  Accent is important, but not at the expense of grammar (the rules of language) and conversation (the synthesis of language).  I think the best accent is the standard BBC World Service accent  (O.K., I am biased).  However, there is one accent that is very, very interesting—that of the interpreters for the highest Chinese government leaders.  They certainly don’t follow American English as a rule, nor British English, and of course such people do not speak in “Chinese English”.  They seem to chart their own linguistic course, following nobody, a linguistic category to themselves—and they are very competent and pleasing to the ear.  People, these are the ones to listen to!  I wish I knew who they were, and if their work was on a collection of study tapes.  They follow no one else, but rather make their own mark on the world.  It is totally authentic. <br />
e )  On independence in language learning.  We now change from the problems of “dependence” to the issue of “independence” in language learning.  I believe you need linguistic independence, if you are to survive in your goal of studying English, on the go, on your own after you graduate, without a foreigner.  Why is this so?  Consider:<br />
(i)  You need to go it alone, as there are not enough foreign speakers for everyone—even in Beijing or Shanghai. <br />
(ii) Very few people will help you, if at all.  Remember, most foreigners in China (except the short-stay tourists) are not here to “deepen their knowledge of China” (as an intrinsic thing in itself).  They are here for various purposes of their own, they have an agenda, and China is their zone of endeavor, their zone of struggle, their zone of service.  (Remember, “means to an end”, not an “end in itself”.)  They don’t want you popping up in front of them in Wangfujing asking for linguistic favors.  You need to know this!  However, there is something good and profitable hidden inside this shocking “brick wall”, which can turn out to your advantage—for some of you.  More on this later. <br />
(iii) The further from the big cities you go, the harder it is to find foreigners.  Moreover, the different regions of China tend to attract different types of foreigner.  For example, Xin Jiang has become a huge, huge playground for many Japanese, since their country is so densely populated.  (I like Xin Jiang as a huge playground, too!)  Many American tourists stay in the eastern, coastal provinces because in their eyes the service infrastructure is more stable and predictable.  As for Qinghai and Tibet, those who want adventure and “the exotic” flock there.  Remember, it is harder to find a foreigner (let alone a foreigner you can make a friendship with), the farther away from the big cities or tourist sites you go.  <br />
(iv) This reason and the next do not involve foreigners.  Many “language centers” are not client-oriented!  (That is, they don’t care first of all about you).  They are money-oriented; hey, they are a business-for-profit, right?  Sometimes, their staff workers are not very satisfactory, not very competent, and certainly not effective.  They know what is motivating you and many others—where you want to go, and what you want to get.  (In a gold rush, it is not the gold miners who typically make the money—it is the shopkeepers who supply them with what they need to live on and operate with!)  So, when you consider language centers, choose carefully! <br />
(v) _Once more, it ends with you.  Only you understand what you need, or want, exactly.  No one else does.  If they say they do, are they trying to sell you something?  To make it to the end of the journey, you need to be independent; to be successfully independent, you need to know what you want.  It is likely that few people will help you; perhaps for a few of you no one will.  That’s O.K.  You now have your freedom to win on your terms. <br />
Conclusion—This section, “Philosophical roots of learning English”, has been rather long.  However, I feel it was necessary, because the key to a successful study of English, on the go, on your own, where there is no foreigner is attitude, and the foundation to good attitude is a good philosophy.  In this section, I wanted to discuss thoughts, feelings and attitudes.  The rest of the text will discuss actions you can take, and the events you must deal with.</p>
