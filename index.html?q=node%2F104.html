(1) Title: “Braveheart”. <br />
 <br />
(2) Introduction: This is a story about freedom, love, and ancient culture.  Through the character of William Wallace (“Braveheart”), we see the aspirations of love, freedom and destiny acted out. <br />
 <br />
(3) Setting (time): The story takes place in the Middle Ages, during the reigns of Edward I of England, and (briefly) during the reign of his son, Edward II. <br />
 <br />
(4) Setting (place): The story takes place in Scotland, as well as in England. <br />
 <br />
(5) Characters: The characters are as follows: <br />
       William Wallace (“Braveheart”) was Scottish.  He lost most of his family (to the English) when he was a young boy.  His uncle adopted him, and taught him “how to use his head, and then, the sword”.  William Wallace was brave, yet clever.  He had a vision for the freedom of the Scottish people, from the English.  He was also a mighty lover. <br />
      King Edward I of England (Edward “Long-Shanks”) was cruel, selfish and cunning.  He was a good strategist, who knew how to manage his kingdom.  He represented everything that the Scottish hated. <br />
       William Wallace’s first love came into his life when he was a young man.  She was beautiful and  innocent.   They married secretly, to avoid the local noble’s interference.  However, she was killed.  Indirectly, she controlled William Wallace’s actions for the rest of his life, for almost everything he did thereafter was in revenge for her killing. <br />
       Robert Bruce was a Scottish noble, who later became the first king of the free Scotland.  He was a young, inexperienced man, who was taught by his own father to become a strong man, who would lead Scotland in the future. <br />
       William Wallace’s second lover was a French princess, a member of Edward I’s court.  She was sent to William Wallace as an ambassador, but later on fell in love with him. <br />
 <br />
(6) Plot Summary: The story proceeds as follows: <br />
       In the beginning of the story, William Wallace’s father (and others) rebel against the English.  They fail, and most of the family is executed by the English.  William Wallace survives, and is adopted by his uncle, who raises him. <br />
       In his early manhood, William Wallace falls in love with a local woman.  They marry secretly, as the local (English) noble was interfering in the marriages of all the local people.  However, the woman was caught, and executed unfairly.  In revenge, William Wallace killed many English, and became an outlaw. <br />
       The story continues, with William Wallace and many other Scottish (and Irish) fighting against the English, notably at the Battles of Stirling and Falkirk.  The Scottish are victorious at first, although they have difficulties later. <br />
       During the this time, Robert Bruce develops as a leader in his own right.  He goes from being an inexperienced noble, to a suitable leader of men.  His father, who is dying of leprosy, is extremely cunning and ruthless, and he uses this ability to further the political fortunes of Robert Bruce.  Ultimately, this brings down William Wallace. <br />
       In time, William Wallace is betrayed, captured, tried, and killed.  As he dies, he sees his former lover, as if in a “dream-vision”. <br />
       Some time after William Wallace’s death, the Scottish rise up again, and this time, under the leadership of Robert Bruce, they defeat the English at the Battle of Bannock Burn. <br />
 <br />
(7) Conflict: There are many levels of tension and conflict in this story: <br />
       Will Scotland be free?  This question is acted out, not only in the military and political sense, but also in the hearts and minds of all involved. <br />
       There is also a conflict between Edward I and (i) the Scottish, who are in rebellion against him, (ii) his own son, who is not fit to be king after him, and (iii) the French, who were struggling against the English for power and influence in the French lands.  Edward I is a very capable king, but as time goes by, his power wanes; by the reign of his son, Edward II, the power of the English in Scotland is broken. <br />
       As the story develops, there is this tension in the story: what will happen to William Wallace?  As others succeed, the fortunes of William Wallace go down, until he is betrayed.  This is something that Robert Bruce’s father knows all too well. <br />
       Another tension in the story is this: will Robert Bruce develop into the leader his father wants him to be? <br />
 <br />
(8) Resolution of Conflict: The above conflicts are resolved as follows: <br />
       Scotland becomes a free country, and this freedom lasts for a few hundred years. <br />
       There are various results.  Edward I controls the Scottish for a season, but as he is getting older and sicker, he loses his control.  His nobles and successors do not have the abilities that he had.  The king also falls into conflict with his son, who hates him, and has useless advisors.  The conflict with the French goes on, as part of a much longer rivalry. <br />
       William Wallace is betrayed, tried, and executed.  However, his death acts as a catalyst for the Scottish to rally around Robert Bruce. <br />
       Robert Bruce finally becomes king of the Scottish, and leads them to victory and freedom from the English. <br />
 <br />
(9) Conclusion: This film is very enjoyable, as it is full of action, aspiration, true love, and dramatic tension.  In particular, there are many interesting “character developments” to follow and appreciate, especially those of William Wallace, and Robert Bruce.  The action scenes are very well done, and the scenery is very beautiful.  Therefore, this is a very exciting and interesting film!</p>
