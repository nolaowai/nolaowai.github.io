“<strong>Belinda and the fire-flies</strong>.”      <em>Written</em>: 2008/7/8 to 2008/7/21.    <br /><em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular.    <em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
When the first fireflies lived on the earth,<br />
everything was uncomplicated,<br />
and the people had all the time they needed to “live in the moment”,<br />
admiring the ancient order of things. <br />
In time that all changed,<br />
as the people became more and more divorced<br />
from what they had loved. <br />
One by one,<br />
the faces of nature died,<br />
or turned into stone and ash,<br />
or ran away–or<br />
simply disappeared. <br />
The only ones who remained were the fire-flies,<br />
but still, they only played and danced together<br />
in fields of long grass,<br />
unsullied by the fingers of man. <br />
In time, even the meadows of long grass became scarce;<br />
only a few remained inviolate. <br />
It was to one of these last fields that I came,<br />
not knowing why I had come. <br />
My mind was elsewhere. <br />
As I blew out the only candle,<br />
plunging the wooden box-cabin <br />
into darkness, <br />
and made ready to lie down on my narrow bed,<br />
I looked out of the window,<br />
out of the small bedroom, and out<br />
into the universe of unseen grass-stems. <br />
There, the fireflies played, and lived out their lives,<br />
as miniature models of<br />
the eternal and infinite universe. <br />
As I stood there,<br />
silent for long minutes,<br />
I saw how far away I had wandered<br />
from the former appreciation of beautiful things. <br />
More poignantly, however, I realized<br />
that I had not only forgotten the fire-flies, the stars,<br />
natural beauty, and the universe;<br />
I saw I had neglected you as well,<br />
for it was your presence<br />
that the community of fire-flies represented. <br />
This mystery, they never communicated;<br />
I only discovered it sometime the next day,<br />
far from the meadow of prophecy. <br />
What has been lost in the night<br />
cannot be retrieved in the day,<br />
nor what has been lost over time<br />
be recaptured on a moment’s regret. <br />
Like the stars,<br />
the fireflies were numerous and entrancing to watch,<br />
but they could not be touched or collected. <br />
Thus, over the past few days,<br />
I have contemplated you,<br />
but given up every thought of gathering you up,<br />
as pearls from a broken necklace,<br />
scattered on the forest floor.               <br />

“<strong>Songbird in the shadows</strong>.”  <em>Written</em>: 2008/7/10 to 2008/7/15. <br /><em>Beats / Syllables</em>: 4 beats per line / irregular.  <em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None. <br />
 <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 1</em>: <br />
Little bird, little bird, hidden in the tree, <br />
Calling from the shadows, as we lie on the ground. <br />
Your non-stop voice is urgent, and you won’t slow down or stop; <br />
The times are short and fading fast, although the sun is high. <br />
We lie upon a blanket, our ears so near the grass, <br />
Our sight among the branches, our minds throughout the world. <br />
You do not come to charm us, or draw us into mirth, <br />
The voice is like a sponge of wine, upon a hyssop stalk. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 2</em>: <br />
The sun above is cruel and hot, the sky bereft and bare, <br />
But under spreading canopy of woven leaves and twigs, <br />
The world is safe, and dreams can play, on shaded plot of grass. <br />
Yet even they move inch by inch, as melts the ebbing day. <br />
We lie together on the ground, in silence and in awe, <br />
Admiring you who sings so true, and mulling long the past. <br />
You do not come to sing to us, of things throughout the years, <br />
But drench us in one last love song, for soon the silence comes. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 3</em>: <br />
The years behind were full of pain, but here that matters not, <br />
For strife and woe belong outside, away from sacred shade. <br />
Of foes and riven fellowship, there’s not a sign or sound; <br />
It seems the Garden came again, to briefly show us home. <br />
We lie against the gentle wool, forgetting sorrow’s shame, <br />
Relieved that we can think as one, and let you weave our dreams. <br />
You do not come to make us doze, beside forgetful streams, <br />
Yet give us calm, while there is time, while there is time to live. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 4</em>: <br />
Little bird, little bird, you’ve flown away at last; <br />
We look around to see your form, but nothing moves but leaves. <br />
The sailboats in the harbor, are frozen in the glare, <br />
The fortress on the rocky isle is hemmed within by trees. <br />
We lie some moments, hearts absorbed, with what has passed us by, <br />
The echoes bouncing off our souls, before becoming still. <br />
You did not come to make us sing, or dance upon the grass, <br />
But bid us forth, to part at last, and never meet again. <br />
 <br />

“<strong>As the moonbeams</strong>.”        <em>Written</em>: 2008/8/29.  <br /><em>Beats / Syllables</em>: 4–3–4–3–4–3–4–4–3 (verses, per line); 4–4–4–4 (chorus, per line). <br /><em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse One</em>: <br />
As the moon-beams leave shadows in forest of pine, <br />
That are taken away by the dawn. <br />
As the mist on the fields strokes the grasses with dew, <br />
Giving life to the roots until noon. <br />
As the clouds that hung golden at threshold of dusk, <br />
Then snuffed out ere day’s mass is done. <br />
So it is too, from may-flies to peaks, <br />
For they fall, and they waste, and they<br />
       wilt, and they fade... <br />
But it shall not be so with you. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus One</em>: <br />
It shall not be so with you, who I’ve known, <br />
For a life and a day, of things I can’t count, <br />
Of noodles and travels and pearls of the soul, <br />
That cover the land and the folds of our hearts. <br />
 <br />
 <br /><em>Verse Two</em>: <br />
We know who is faithless, and know who is true, <br />
Yet true ones are harder to find. <br />
‘Midst oceans of honey and cherry-hued lips, <br />
We gather our pebbles of gall. <br />
If ten swear their heart, or fidelity’s clasp, <br />
It’s certain that nine won’t return. <br />
So it has been, on life’s dry plateau, <br />
For they strive, and they doubt, and they <br />
       drift, and they fall... <br />
But it shall not be so with you. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus Two</em>: <br />
It shall not be so with you, for I’m drawn, <br />
By your heart and your thoughts, of the life that we shared, <br />
Of absence and gazes and similar quests, <br />
That cross the wide sea and portals of dreams. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br /><em>Verse Three</em>: <br />
Still comes the night and the killer of dreams, <br />
Reality’s shriveling gaze. <br />
Old friends are soon parted, and never come back; <br />
They fade in eternity’s vales. <br />
Yet crueller than these are the ones who remain, <br />
In sight, but nowhere to touch. <br />
So it will be, as you walk through the years, <br />
For they came, and they went, and they <br />
       fell, and have passed... <br />
But it shall not be so with you. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus Three</em>: <br />
It shall not be so with you, for like peaks, <br />
I saw you from far, and ran to get close, <br />
And as gathering dusk overwhelms all the land, <br />
You remain in the sun, and bid me go on. <br />
 <br />
 <br /><em>Verse Four </em>: <br />
The pages of life will not stop on command; <br />
They pass and move on like the clouds. <br />
The years of desertion are suddenly turned, <br />
For it’s you who has found a new home. <br />
Yet even your rising can make you alone; <br />
You gaze back on what you once were. <br />
So you are now, with your children in hand, <br />
For he came, and you met, and you <br />
       joined, and now walk... <br />
And I shall be glad in my soul. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus Four</em>: <br />
And I shall be glad in my soul, as I stand, <br />
On the wide open spaces of shimmering sand, <br />
My eyes to the heavens, to where you have flown, <br />
For your dream is begun, and given you joy! <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Memo to Calypso</strong>.”      <em>Written</em>: 2008/11/11 to 2008/11/12. <br /><em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular.      <em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None.      <em>Plan</em>: 1) Complaint.  2) Interlude, towards hope.  3) About Calypso’s mother.  4) The triumph of belonging. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
When I am without shelter and feel unloved, <br />
And when the sanctity of blood is washed away, <br />
Like ink from a school child’s writing brush, <br />
I look out of the window at the autumn trees, <br />
Losing all their leaves in the dusty gales, <br />
Or at the passing clouds in the darkening sky. <br />
I stand for long minutes at the window, <br />
My nose turning cold against the glass, <br />
For I am so intent on watching the people below, <br />
As they walk in and out of the darkness, <br />
Between pools of brilliance under the street lamps. <br />
The city beyond is shrouded in overwhelming detail, <br />
Rendered indistinct by the fumes of a million fires. <br />
Like a startled pigeon trying to find its roost at night, <br />
I flutter in confusion among imaginary branches, <br />
But the windows to the hoped-for rooms remain shut. <br />
I wander alone down long and silent corridors, <br />
Looking for those who should open a door for me, <br />
And welcome me inside as one of them. <br />
They stare out at me through the door-window, <br />
Then watch in silence as I am washed away, <br />
Downstream along life’s fast-flowing mill stream. <br />
Thus are the ties of blood-kin rendered ineffectual, <br />
With silent understanding by some the best I can hope for. <br />
Who am I in this strange and forsaken world? <br />
Where is my home and they who I belong with? <br />
 <br />
My life and my hopes no longer live in futility, <br />
At the gates of those who merely made me. <br />
I exist instead in the lives of those who chose me, <br />
Then carried me in love to the present day. <br />
In them I see lost blood-ties replaced by love-choices. <br />
 <br />
Oh child of destiny, remember your new mother, <br />
Who, despising all the hardships of life, <br />
Claimed you as her own and wove you, <br />
As the finest of silk carpets, over the years! <br />
Your home lies near the bamboo groves, <br />
In Li Shui, one village among hundreds, <br />
Within the land of fish-ponds and rice-fields.   <br />
Every woman like your mother made this land, <br />
Bourne along by life’s great river, but never submitting, <br />
Never allowing herself to be buried by circumstance. <br />
Even now, as you share tea from the mountain bushes, <br />
Sitting quietly at the sofa together, conversing, <br />
Infusing the other’s thoughts and poise, <br />
With your own appreciative silence,  <br />
Remember everything she did to form you. <br />
The years are slower now, and so too her vigor, <br />
But the memories run strong, strong as the current, <br />
Which bore flecks of sand from distant Qinghai, <br />
Immortal plateau-land of silent, brooding beauty, <br />
Down cascading chasms of rocks and water-spray, <br />
Past the fertile gardens of Four-Mountains, <br />
And into the fish-pools of bountiful Jiang Su. <br />
So too, she formed your nature and mind, <br />
She who carried, dragged, led and forged you, <br />
Training your mind and releasing your feet, <br />
So that you might walk your own corridors, <br />
In Cathay’s finest universities, your domain. <br />
The powerful rise when you come before them; <br />
Men cover their mouths when you speak. <br />
Yet, for all this, you do not forget your mother, <br />
The one who bore you on her own back, <br />
Who even now carries you in her thoughts, <br />
As the last stages of a mighty river carries a paper boat, <br />
Down at last to the waiting ocean, the open waters, <br />
And the dawn of further adventure. <br />
The horizons, the eternal, opulent horizons beckon, <br />
Calling you away from the sea-caves – <br />
With their beaches littered with ink-less writing-brushes, <br />
And the pools of reflective water in the grottoes, <br />
Their uncertain portrait disturbed only by tears – <br />
Calling you away from all these, to the sea. <br />
The prow shudders through the racing swells, <br />
As the banks of oars dip and rise in unison, <br />
And the last seagulls overhead return landward. <br />
The night arises, and under the brilliant stars, <br />
The wooden shell of dreams moves under a gentle wind. <br />
Above, the stars become scattered chips of diamond, <br />
Laid down with night’s ink, the darkness, upon the sky, <br />
Heaven’s paper scroll, wonder’s ultimate calligraphy. <br />
 <br />
As you cross the open seas, like Odysseus, <br />
And reach other dry lands and observe them, <br />
May you remember your mother, who bore you, <br />
Who experienced pain’s agony and nameless joy, <br />
All because heaven gave her a daughter, <br />
As a bulwark against reproach and futility, <br />
Through which she might boast against loneliness. <br />
She is the root, from which you have sprung, <br />
And her home among the bamboo groves the place, <br />
From where your life, as mighty vines of ivy, <br />
Courses over the entire earth! <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Preparing To Visit Persia</strong>.”  <br /><em>Written</em>:  2008/9/18 to 2008/9/19. <br /><em>Beats / Syllables</em>:   10 per line, in four-line groups. <br /><em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None. <br />
 <br />
If all that was beautiful in the world, <br />
Were concentrated into ten small drops, <br />
Then nine of them would belong to Persia, <br />
Leaving the world to fight over the last. <br />
 <br />
If I must leave a final legacy, <br />
A memorial by way of writing, <br />
Then I would fain scatter it everywhere, <br />
While walking through the fresh land of Hafiz. <br />
 <br />
Too long have I brooded over Persia, <br />
Stealing subtle glimpses of her gardens, <br />
Her vast deserts of salt and silent sand, <br />
Her rampart mountains to the north and west. <br />
 <br />
An epic crossroads of many ages, <br />
Made famous by many and loved by more, <br />
Yet always tasted or felt from afar, <br />
Perception three times removed from the source. <br />
 <br />
Every piece of dried fruit from the bazaar, <br />
Eaten alone in dusty recesses, <br />
In my own far distant land of exile, <br />
Is imagination’s key to new dreams. <br />
 <br />
The wind outside in the trees is restless, <br />
And it stirs up my long-imprisoned soul, <br />
To break free like leaves torn from the branches, <br />
Finding repose in the land of Persia. <br />
 <br />
As I plan once more to leave my homeland, <br />
There are those who question why I would go, <br />
Yet I leave them on the banks of Tagus, <br />
Preferring instead the road to the east. <br />
 <br />
Drawn from the vale of long futility, <br />
Watching the course of slow degradation, <br />
I cannot refuse destiny proffered, <br />
Opportunity granted from the flint. <br />
 <br />
I remember my three former classmates, <br />
Who crossed my paths thirty years earlier, <br />
But then disappeared into history, <br />
Hidden as three petals in desert sands. <br />
 <br />
The sands of hostility and distrust, <br />
Blown hard by an inconsolable wind, <br />
And of circumstance’s cruel hindrances, <br />
Have fallen silent for a brief season. <br />
 <br />
A brief and unfathomable moment, <br />
As of a butterfly perched on a leaf, <br />
Poised uncertainly between two seasons, <br />
Surveying what has passed and what will come. <br />
 <br />
Thus I enter a place fully unknown, <br />
Void of familiar reference points, <br />
Yet celebrated among all peoples, <br />
As a home for poets and travelers. <br />
 <br />
Grudge me not this short time of wandering, <br />
Within the holy moments and places, <br />
Along the footpaths once enjoyed by kings, <br />
When the wind becomes still from its clamor. <br />
 <br />
Within a garden’s walled security, <br />
Or alone on an endless desert road, <br />
But also among the throng of others, <br />
Let me see and enter into this land. <br />
 <br />
As one who swims with whales in the ocean, <br />
Or who flies as a glossamer pigeon, <br />
Let me forget my own fragility, <br />
And follow after destiny’s summons. <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Above a Persian village</strong>.”      <em>Written</em>: 2008/10/11.      <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The water channel above the village crosses the hillside. <br />
Behind the walnut groves, now rendered immortal in beauty, <br />
Even as their yellow leaves announce the coming death from winter, <br />
The water course takes me far from the madness of things past. <br />
 <br />
The wind is cold and comfortable, <br />
Blowing past the ears with the faintest of whispers. <br />
I stand, with my face to the cold, <br />
And my back to the just-sufficient sunlight. <br />
 <br />
The never-silent, ever-whispering flow of the water is calming. <br />
It bears along the rolling flecks of sand, <br />
Over and over, into and out of hollows. <br />
It sweeps clean the small patches of water-weed, <br />
And scours beneath the larger stones. <br />
Around stands the silence of the reaped and waiting fields, <br />
And the holy sanctuary of the green and golden-leaved walnut groves. <br />
Here live the magpies, who, respectful of the silence,<br />
Call out by measure. <br />
Not so the crows down in the village. <br />
For so many generations, the water-course has crossed the land, <br />
Sustaining the fields, and offering peace and relief, <br />
To all who would stand still for it. <br />
Oh land, oh solitary small bird, let me never forget you. <br />
Never leave me, either. <br />

“<strong>Torshi the pickle</strong>.”    <em>Written</em>: 2008/10/11.    <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Semi-irregular. <br /><em>Note</em>: The word “<em>torshi</em>” means “pickle” (sour vegetables) in Persian.  (TOR-shee) <br />
 <br />
      <br /><em>Verse 1</em>. <br />
I knew a girl (or thought I did), <br />
From far-off Tabriz town. <br />
She said she loved me through and through, <br />
And steadfast would remain. <br />
Nothing in life’s hardships, <br />
The boring road of drudge, <br />
Could make her trip or deviate, <br />
From pledge of constant love. <br />
Her name (she said) was Torshi, <br />
For me that would suffice, <br />
I dropped my hands and bared my heart, <br />
Resolved to take what came. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus 1</em>. <br />
Oh woe to me from Torshi, <br />
The one with pickled soul, <br />
Whose every word was vinegar, <br />
Devoid of love or balm! <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 2</em>. <br />
Before too long we walked as one, <br />
Along the pavement path, <br />
Beside the lake in El-Goli, <br />
Surrounded by the throngs. <br />
They came from every walk of life, <br />
That Tabriz had to show, <br />
Arm-in-arm and step-in-step, <br />
And heedless of all else. <br />
The mist from drifting fountain spray, <br />
It blew into their eyes. <br />
I walked along with Torshi dear, <br />
I thought of nothing else. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus 2</em>. <br />
Oh woe to me from Torshi, <br />
Who seemed with honey drenched. <br />
Those sweet words that she used to sing, <br />
Were needles caked in salt! <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 3</em>. <br />
I left her in the city oft, <br />
To sell books far and wide. <br />
Although immense the distances, <br />
Our hearts were never far. <br />
I thought and dreamed and wrote of her, <br />
Heedless of my friends, <br />
Who said they knew another girl, <br />
That never smiled or sang. <br />
I wondered if such things could be, <br />
As we sat beside the lake, <br />
Beside the sighing samovars, <br />
Our gazes tight enmeshed. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus 3</em>. <br />
Oh woe to me from Torshi, <br />
A lamp of olive oil. <br />
For even oil runs out one day, <br />
And drops us in the dark! <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 4</em>. <br />
As time drew on my friends drew off, <br />
For Torshi was my girl. <br />
She knew this as we walked along, <br />
Beside the lover’s lake. <br />
As autumn waned and winter came, <br />
Her love-dust fell away, <br />
Replaced at last by bitter soul, <br />
With wistful gazes down. <br />
I chose to stay and not to leave, <br />
She let me make my vows. <br />
I cherish deep within the hope, <br />
Of summertime renewed. <br />
 <br /><em>Chorus 4</em>. <br />
I wait for you dear Torshi, <br />
Although I pine away. <br />
Can pickled greens be turned to sweet, <br />
Beside the lover’s lake? <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Crossing through Lorestan</strong>.”    <em>Written</em>: 2008/10/14.    <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular. <br /><em>Note</em>: Lorestan is a region within Persia. <br />
 <br />
                                                                                   <br />
If you would understand the soul of Lorestan,<br />
You must go with the flow of what the earth gives you: <br />
A vast expanse of unevenly rolling hills, <br />
Sharp escarpments on occasion to balance the landscape, <br />
And a constantly winding and compromising road. <br />
 <br />
Desert upon first glance, <br />
With tired-looking soils of various shades of tan and neglected, <br />
Desicated chocolate, <br />
The wave-plain of Lorestan has pockets of suitable field-land. <br />
Only the utterly determined need try, and they do. <br />
 <br />
Following after the few underground water-courses, <br />
The trees and wheat fields – <br />
Few in number – <br />
Live in the balance between hardship and utter desolation. <br />
 <br />
It is mid-autumn, and the poplars are changing color, <br />
One by one. <br />
Harrow-marks have etched contour lines on the almost parched fields, <br />
While the slopes elsewhere are likewise scored <br />
By the feet of passing sheep. <br />
 <br />
Outside a few villages, <br />
No one is on the land, save certain shepherds, <br />
Their squadrons of sheep and a dog or two. <br />
These glean the harvested wheat fields by permission. <br />
 <br />
From a distance, this land is virtually silent. <br />
At noon, the landscape is harsh in its brightness, <br />
And even the poplar groves in the valleys are hard to look at. <br />
 <br />
The next town, with all its trappings of habitation, <br />
No longer dazzles the traveler’s eyes. <br />
One’s heart is drawn back to the open land, <br />
And the dry wheat fields. <br />

 <br /><em>Verse 1</em>. <br />
Oh sacred groves on mountainside, <br />
Tall trees among the stones. <br />
From out of thee flows forth the stream, <br />
That waters Hamadan. <br />
From far around on autumn days, <br />
The people come to rest, <br />
Among the leaves of flashing gold, <br />
And gurgle of the brook. <br />
Your fame it rests forever strong, <br />
To all the passers by, <br />
To those who linger as they can, <br />
And those who linger on. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 2</em>. <br />
For out of thee came forth a word, <br />
To Persia’s ancient tribes, <br />
From Xerxes and from Darius, <br />
To all they would command. <br />
Carved on high stone in cuneiform, <br />
In never-changing words, <br />
The proclamation of the kings, <br />
Revealed for all to see. <br />
Your fame oh kings forever rests, <br />
To all the nations shown, <br />
To those who traveled home and spoke, <br />
To those from Persia’s bounds. <br />
 <br /><em>Verse 3</em>. <br />
Now out of thee there comes once more, <br />
New heralds from the kings, <br />
Proclaiming new the Persian soul, <br />
From Indus to the Nile. <br />
Though draped in black and diffident, <br />
And bearing books and pens, <br />
They carry with them all the grace, <br />
Required for glory’s deeds. <br />
Your fame will rest forevermore, <br />
Whate’r the soil you tread. <br />
The world belongs to such as you, <br />
Fair nightingales of peace! <br />

“<strong>At a shrine in Shiraz</strong>.”    <em>Written</em>: 2008/10/20.    <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular. <br /><em>Note</em>: There is a shrine in Shiraz, in Persia, whose interior walls are completely covered in small chips of mirror-glass.  This poem is about my impressions. <br />
 <br />
Imagine if the many faces of a diamond, <br />
Throwing out light in every direction, <br />
Were taken from the ring, <br />
And turned into chips of mirror-glass, <br />
Covering completely the inner walls of a shrine. <br />
Tens of many thousands adorn the walls, <br />
And they look out in many directions, <br />
Like a three-dimensional mosaic, <br />
Revealing the foothills of eternity’s topography. <br />
I scorned the mirrored walls at first, <br />
As tasteless and unfit to rival, <br />
To compete with the Sun King’s meeting rooms. <br />
On a floor completely covered with Persian carpets, <br />
Perfect art strewn about, <br />
With the everyday service of newspaper pages, <br />
At an autumn park-picnic, <br />
A few of the devout were praying, <br />
Or else enjoying the sanctuary of place and moment, <br />
Studying away from the soul’s turmoil outside. <br />
I scorned the tasteless chips of glass, <br />
Until I came close to the wall, <br />
And perceived heaven’s threshold. <br />
 <br />
I saw myself and others anew and not as before. <br />
Part of us moved as usual, <br />
But the other half, <br />
Equally mixed with the here-and-now, <br />
Revealed itself from another world. <br />
It was certainly not “the other side of the mirror”. <br />
I paced slowly along the walls, <br />
With a sense of mounting intoxication, <br />
Staring deep into what lay behind the mirrors. <br />
As a single fish in the ocean, <br />
I entered immense and swirling clouds, <br />
Of emerald and silver glass-plankton. <br />
It transported my tired soul, <br />
Exhausted and jaded, <br />
To places it had never been before, <br />
Or even considered. <br />
I walked one way along the wall, <br />
And then back again, <br />
Desiring to throw myself into swirl again, <br />
To lose my entire consciousness, <br />
In the tumbling cosmos of the glass-plankton. <br />
It seemed I moved through the garden of paradise, <br />
Seeing the same beings of day-after-day, <br />
But in their future and intended form. <br />
I lost all awareness of those around me, <br />
And threw myself again and again, <br />
Against the unseen wall, <br />
Seeing the other side and wanting to come in, <br />
Desiring to leave this world now, <br />
And move in the undescribable refractions of paradise, <br />
Among the swirling particles of light. <br />
It was the first time in my life, <br />
That I had seen the verges of heaven, <br />
Contemplated it, <br />
And wanted to come inside. <br />
 <br />
I was now alone in the shrine, <br />
Save for one other on a carpet, <br />
Somewhere in the opposite corner. <br />
I walked too far along the mirrored wall, <br />
And past an open doorway to the courtyard outside. <br />
A solitary cat sat next to an empty chair, <br />
Licking itself abstractedly. <br />
I walked through the doorway, <br />
And back into the world of shapes. <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Lines written at Cyrus’ tomb at Pasargad, on the 20th anniversary of my mother’s death</strong>.” <br /><em>Written</em>: 2008/10/24.    <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
It was your words, oh king, that brought me to this land. <br />
From long ago, in a land of exile myself, <br />
Surrounded by over-worn textbooks and over-bearing masters, <br />
Walking the silent marble corridors of tradition’s proving grounds, <br />
And losing myself among the silent, leaf-littered woodland, <br />
Tucked away in England’s immortal hills, <br />
I pondered your words : Grudge me not this piece of earth. <br />
Silent as blocks of long-weathered stone, <br />
In a long valley surrounded by oft-rent and convulsed hills, <br />
Shutting out all save the pilgrim, <br />
Your words became a reminder, a promise, <br />
A reason for crossing the geography of life. <br />
Oh king : I have walked through this barren and futile life, <br />
With its occasional tokens of refreshment; <br />
I have wandered over the plains and valleys of numerous countries, <br />
Surveying their high mountains of rock and snow; <br />
I have observed the ways of the peoples, <br />
And spoken a few of their tongues. <br />
For thirty years, I have wanted to come here, <br />
One of the few touchstones of the soul, my soul, <br />
In a vast pin-cushion of places visited. <br />
My eyes have roved over so many places, <br />
And my shoes gathered their dust; <br />
I have invaded the nations (but not as you), <br />
Marking my progress on their maps with a felt-tip pen. <br />
I leave no monuments, save fleeting memories in the minds of common folk, <br />
Along the post-roads of Asia. <br />
Of all who were famed among ephemeral mortals, <br />
Only you and Prizhevalsky have I honored,  <br />
Leaving for a while the clamor of the living, <br />
To see myself your final homes, monuments hewn by the respectful. <br />
Like you, I have been directed as a water-channel – <br />
Smaller indeed by far, but nonetheless among certain nations. <br />
Your tomb has been broken into, become subject to desacration many times, <br />
By both the strong and the passer-by. <br />
Nonetheless, the raw majesty of those blocks of stone – <br />
Hewn, scarred, and weathered – convey a message that I hope will<br />
Never be effaced from the minds of those who pass by and consider. <br />
Thus, arriving here after these years, <br />
I cover my lips with my hand and say, <br />
Oh king, may your memory live forever! <br />
Oh mother, here I remember you, <br />
As I have often done these past twenty years, <br />
As I now cross the arid, rock-strewn earth-scape of Persia. <br />
I am not far from your purview of life, <br />
For it was you who cast in me – <br />
By blood, by example, by training, by word – <br />
The ability to consider all of earth’s horizons to be my own, <br />
Irrespective of boundary, or tongue, or culture. <br />
You have equipped me, so that I might carry little, yet see much. <br />
Your influence has affected everything I have done, <br />
And my exploits have been very much an extension of your fingers. <br />
Indeed, “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof”, <br />
But for your quiet influence, <br />
How else would I have known how to apprehend it for myself? <br />
There is very little I do, or say, or think, <br />
Which was not influenced by you. <br />
Your resting place under a large, spreading beech tree is known by few, <br />
And soon we who visit will be no more. <br />
For you, there are no huge blocks of hewn stone, <br />
Only the enfolding tree roots. <br />
Instead, you have left behind an unseen memorial, <br />
The gift of a mother to her sons, <br />
Who receive from her hands, and then flow freely over the entire earth. <br />
 <br />
Oh mother!  May you live forever! <br />
May our passage through this world be, as it were, <br />
The extension of your aspirations! <br />
Today, I have kept my dreams, <br />
And walked around the tomb at Pasargad twice – <br />
Once for Cyrus, and once for you. <br />
It is not the end of a journey, but a way-station, <br />
For there is yet much to do, <br />
And my traveling box of pins is nowhere near empty. <br />
 <br />
The monument is silent, for the curious have departed, <br />
And left the stones to the ever-bleaching sun. <br />
So too is the beech tree silent, <br />
For the leaves have fallen to the ground, hiding everything. <br />
As for me, I leave behind a trail of slowly settling Persian dust. <br />
Come, oh memories, oh remembered ones, and travel in me. <br />
There is still much more for me to do. <br />
 <br />
 <br />

“<strong>Reflections at a water cistern</strong>.”       cf,  Jeremiah 2:13. <br /><em>Written</em>: 2008/10/24 to 2008/11/5.  <em>Beats / Syllables</em>: Irregular.    <em>Rhyme Scheme</em>: None. <br /><em>Note</em>: Yazd is an ancient city in Persia. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
The former caravanserai stands in the middle of nowhere, <br />
Seven days walk from Yazd. <br />
Lovingly restored, sumptuously adorned with desert carpets <br />
That are harsh to the fingers and touching to the soul, <br />
The twelve-sided building enfolds a world, <br />
A courtyard far removed from the modern dispensation. <br />
 <br />
Lying down inside one of the alcoves upon the roof, <br />
On an old and slightly ragged desert carpet, <br />
I looked at one of the timeless, iconic emblems of Persia: <br />
The complex yet subdued tan hues of the brickwork, <br />
Meeting abruptly with the achingly pure and harsh blue sky, <br />
And nothing else. <br />
The caravanserai was now a hotel for wealthy global tourists, <br />
And was far removed from the lives of common Persians. <br />
 <br />
Outside the walls, twenty minutes walk into the desert, <br />
Was a cluster of bushes, rumored to have a spring of cold water. <br />
Breakfast as yet unserved, I went to the spring. <br />
Leaving the walled-in, muffled security of the slowly awakening hotel <br />
Required force, to rip open an unseen shell and enter the uncertain. <br />
 <br />
A few others were already on the gravel road, <br />
In various stages of pilgrimage towards the spring. <br />
I followed them, until they stopped in the way, and turned back. <br />
We passed by each other in silence. <br />
 <br />
The land around the road was dotted with long-ago dried out bushes, <br />
Extending far ahead to the slopes of the mountains. <br />
For the first time, I saw a land completely pure of any human presence, <br />
Save the road at my feet. <br />
I stopped, and the crunching footsteps became a silence I could feel around me. <br />
For several minutes, I stood in a place, <br />
So far removed from the former world. <br />
Is this how it is, in vast and uncharted realms of the world, <br />
Where people have not yet entered? <br />
 <br />
Three small birds flew together towards the far-off mountains, <br />
Diminishing faint chirps passing through immense voids of silence, <br />
Until the stillness and the distance consumed them. <br />
I walked on, until I came close to the large cluster of juniper bushes, <br />
Surely there because of water below. <br />
 <br />
I felt the silence in my ears, inside my head, <br />
As if it were noise. <br />
I too became rooted, fixed for a moment in the long-dried soil. <br />
Not a single creature moved among the bushes,  <br />
Yet, the morning new and fresh,<br />
I imagined the unseen foxes, and stayed apart. <br />
 <br />
Who knows if there was ever a gently-rising pool of water, <br />
Straight from the mountain’s roots far away, <br />
Somewhere among the juniper roots? <br />
Only the mice and the birds knew. <br />
 <br />
The rest of the world had completely receded <br />
Away from the waiting desert and its blue roof above. <br />
I stood there for a while, and walked over to a nearby rainwater cistern. <br />
Aged, its concrete walls at once unfinished and cracked, <br />
It held a thin layer of hardened mud, and a few lost bricks. <br />
It was meant to catch the waters of flash-floods coming off the mountains,<br />
Whenever they came –<br />
But for who, so far away from settlement? <br />
I stood at the edge and looked down inside, <br />
Imagining the trapped trying to get out, back into the desert. <br />
The shallowly-etched watercourse over the flat land, <br />
Marked out in air and settled dust, <br />
Came up to the cistern’s edge. <br />
Not even imaginations came down from the far-away mountains. <br />
 <br />
Breakfast was almost ready; the bus was due to leave. <br />
The walk back to the caravanserai was a time-objective, <br />
And the desert shared none of its inner message with me. <br />
Only those on the way out from chaos, <br />
Who seek peace somewhere among the juniper roots, <br />
Who stand in silence, <br />
Can find the waters that flow in every desert. <br />
